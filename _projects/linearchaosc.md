  data: <p>LinearChaos is a series of performance systems made with <a href="http://www.derivative.ca/"
    target="_blank">TouchDesigner</a>.<br/>It has gone through several iterations
    and rewrites.</p> <p>This is the third (and most recent) rewrite.<br/> It uses
    completely new geometry and rendering systems.<br/> I probably should have renamed
    it, but now I can't bring myself to do so.</p> <p>The system is based on spacial
    and temporal distortion of geometric primitives.<br/> It represents the interplay
    of simplicity and complexity. And I think it looks neat.</p>
