    It was featured at Boston's 2015 Figment First Night.</p>\r\n<p>The game is projected
    on the surface of a 30 foot geodesic dome, from 3 projectors mounted on towers
    surrounding the dome.</p> \r\n<p>Users connect to a local wireless network using
    smartphones. Once connected, they enter the dome and use any modern mobile browser
    to control a virtual game paddle by pointing their phone at the dome. Multiple
    users play simultaneously, bouncing balls off of their paddles to hit and destroy
    bricks. Various game modifiers appear when destroying certain bricks to add features
    such as changing paddle size and speed, or causing balls to strike through bricks
    instead of bouncing off of them.</p>\r\n<p>The game engine and rendering system
    is written in C++, using <a href=\"http://openframeworks.cc/\" target=\"_blank\">openFrameworks</a>.
    The code is available on <a href=\"https://github.com/VideoBleep/bleepout\" target=\"_blank\">github</a>.\r\nThe
    control system is written in JavaScript on <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/\" target=\"_blank\">node.js</a>,
