  renderOptions: 
  data: "<p>Kinetic Reflections will allow users to interactively control an audio/visual
    system through movement. It \r\nwill consist of several subsystems, including
    an Input and Control Handler, Interaction Feedback Display, \r\nAudio, and a Render
    Display. In order to provide an evolving and intriguing experience, the system
    as a \r\nwhole will switch periodically between several modes, changing the generated
    imagery, sound, and how \r\nuser interaction is interpreted.</p>\r\n<p>The Input
    and Control Handler will take input from one or more Kinect devices, and interpret
    the data in \r\none of several different ways depending on the current mode. It
    will be implemented with TouchDesigner, \r\nand will communicate with the other
    components of the system through OSC and MIDI messages.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe Interaction
    Feedback Display will provide users with immediate visual representation making
    it readily \r\napparent how the system is interpreting their actions. It will
    use a projection on a nearby wall or screen to \r\nshow an easily understandable
    representation of how the system perceives and engages with the users.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe
    Audio subsystem will take information from the Control Handling and use it to
    trigger playback of audio \r\nclips, and modulate effects parameters. It will
    be implemented with Ableton Live.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe Render Display will take information
    from the \r\nControl subsystem and use it to generate and \r\nmanipulate a visual
    stream which will be projected \r\nonto either a screen or an architectural surface
    \r\nin the installation environment. It will focus less \r\non helping users to
    understand the system, and \r\nmore on visual aesthetics. It will be implemented
    \r\nusing a combination of video clip triggering (with \r\nResolume) and real-time
    generative visualizations \r\n(with TouchDesigner)."
